Imagine you had $1,000,000. Now imagine you had to give away that money and you had the following options to spend the money on:

- **Homeful**: an organization fighting homelessness in San Francisco
  - **$50,000**. Although I believe this organization will reduce suffering a lot, it is restricted to one city and homelessness problem does not have a one-time solution. I think funding to this organization is important, but not a priority.
- **HelpingHand**: A disaster relief organization helping developing countries after a natural disaster
  - **$200,000**. Post disaster repairing costs a lot of money and usually developing countries cannot afford the price. I heard from some news saying it is not ideally effective when other countries are supporting a post-disaster developing country, due to technical problems and lack of basic infrastructure, but I still believe this will save a lot of lives.
- **VitA** (pronounced “vita”): An organization providing vitamin A supplements to children in developing countries
  - **$100,000**. This is a cool program but I doubt on the effectiveness of vitamin A supplements... as far as I know, other more comprehensive vitamin supplement might be better?
- **Pandemic Prepared**: An organization that develops policy proposals around preventing pandemics.
  - **$200,000** Really important and I think this funding is going to create sustainable impact
- **GreenPlanet**: An organization with various efforts (policy drafts, lobbying, grassroots movements) aimed at mitigating climate change
  - **$300,000** Realllyyy important and urgent!!!
- **Happy Chicken**: An organization dedicated at reducing cruelty to chicken in industrial farms.
  - **$50,000** I personally do not think it is a must but if it improves the quality of the meat that counts.
- **UnderstandAI:** A research organization investigating how machine learning works “under the hood” (instead of being a black box).
  - **$100,000** I don't really think it is approachable, in the recent decade?
