# Just an Intro

## To Begin With

About Education... I do not major in Education, although I feel I am always interested in (probably will take an education-related master program in the future?). 

I read a sentence from somewhere and I think it is very true:

> It is terrible that parents become parents without learning anything about education or passing any related exams.

There is something even worse: many parents do not admit they have NORMAL kids. They treat their kids in extreme ways; sometimes they are infants; sometimes they are adults of their age. And what's worse, many parents themselves are still na√Øve inside.

All these above are complaints from a teenager who currently knows nothing about education and parenting ~~(me)~~, but I still believe this information is important to note down.

When a service provider wants to improve its service, they would like to survey their customers. Then why there were never adults asking me whether they are doing a good job as parents? I do not mean that parents are "service-providers". I mean parents should value kids' opinions, as much as they believe how those fancy education experts wrote in journals and books ~~(which I believe most parents will never ever read)~~.

## Stories I have...

Just to re-state that, I am not even close to Education, but I am a kiddo who has been parent-ed. I have my right to judge their parenting skills, in a very objective manner, yay?

Starting from my parents. My mom is a professor doing counselling at a university. I could tell she is somehow professional in education as she majored in Education in her college. I am not quite sure what did she learn in her college time, but I acknowledge that she is a good teacher.

One mistake that many parents who experienced higher education have is that they treat their kids as if they are genius ~~(yes yes they are smart, but not as smart as Einstein, huh?)~~. But I am really lucky that my mom is patient to kids, really patient and tolerant. She is strict, she has her own rules, but most of the time she allows kids to make mistake and always to try again.

By contrast, my dad was not THAT patient. He finished his college with a STEAM major so he was responsible for my math when I was in primary school. He tried so hard to teach me how to use variables and functions to solve tricky math problems, which are not supposedly to be solved by them. It was like he tried to teach me how to build a house systematically when I was just supposed to build a cute little sand castle (*cough* that is a bit exaggerated ). It is not meaningless, in fact, this helps me a lot in my future study. But it was a really tough time for me to learn and for him to teach. Sometimes I burst into tears and cried "this is so hard that only boys can do that" (In Chinese, the word "hard" and "male" share the same pronunciation, that's a homophone joke) and he sit aside still trying to explain how to solve the equation with x, y, and z in it, probably with anger and disappointment. There should be a better way... huh?

Things changed after my dad switched job from a computer engineer to a university teacher. He is much nicer, much more patient and much better at teaching. He explained to me that it is because he now teaches me things that he has prepared and ~~(more importantly)~~he has seen more difficult-to-teach students now and I am comparatively an easy-to-teach one. Good thing, but I cannot suggest every parent find an education-related job to do.

Beside my parents, I have more negative stories from my observation. I stayed with a family for a few weeks and observed their family relations from a third-person's view. In fact, I feel shamed for writing this story down, because I think I could stop the conflict but I was scared at that moment and I did nothing but hid in my room. Anyway, it was that conflict that make me reflect on my family relation and parent-children relations in families around the world.



## My WWHDH

Therefore, I made a method to solve daily argue problems, which is **WWHDH** *(ok I really made this up, without any theories basis or experiments or surveys or whatever, but it does explains a lot of things)*. It is a reflectional method that I believe will smooth tensions in parenting, and this method is for parents. 

It means: 
*W*hat did you want to achieve?
*W*hat method did you use?
*H*ow you think your method would work?
*D*id it work out?
*H*ow would you change your method?

Also it is a good method to reflect on communication issues people have, isn't it?
